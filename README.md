Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) is hazardous or not. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
ðŸ”— NASA Nearest Earth Objects (1910-2024) Dataset

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about asteroids, including their estimated size, velocity, distance from Earth, and classification as hazardous or not.

Key Features:
neo_id - Unique identifier for each asteroid
name - Name assigned by NASA
absolute_magnitude - Intrinsic luminosity of the asteroid
estimated_diameter_min - Minimum estimated size (km)
estimated_diameter_max - Maximum estimated size (km)
orbiting_body - Planet the asteroid orbits (Earth in this dataset)
relative_velocity - Speed relative to Earth (km/h)
miss_distance - Closest distance to Earth (km)
is_hazardous (Target) - Whether the asteroid is potentially hazardous (True or False)
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Handled missing values.
Converted categorical features.
Scaled numerical values.
